# PHP Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP code related to loose comparison.  The code uses strict comparison (`===`) in one part, but could easily be modified to use loose comparison (`==`), which might produce different and unexpected results.

The `bug.php` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.php` offers a corrected version.  The issue highlights the importance of consistently using strict comparison for type-sensitive operations, especially with the possible implicit type conversions in PHP.
